Starting from 3.25.4, we provide release notes through the
AppData file. As such, app stores (like GNOME Software)
can show release notes to users.

Human-readable textual output (similar to this file)
can easily be generated with the following command:

$ appstream-util appdata-to-news data/org.gnome.Contacts.appdata.xml
